<h1>Lake Natoma</h1>

<h2>Lake Natoma is a small lake in the western United States, along the lower American River, between Folsom and Nimbus Dams in Sacramento County, California. The lake is located within the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area which is responsible for maintaining the facilities and bike trails surrounding the lake. Lake Natoma is located 15 miles east of Sacramento, and has 500 surface acres of water.  The total length of lake Natoma is 4 miles.
</h2>

<p>History:
<br>In the 1950s, after the Folsom Dam was constructed as part of the Central Valley project work began on Nimbus Dam which would create Lake Natoma. Lake Natoma was built to manage water  released from Folsom Dam. Lake Natoma is a reservoir that was built in conjunction with the Folsom Dam and Folsom reservoir by the Central Valley Project Authority. In addition to maintaining water flow the lake provides water to irrigation canals and generates hydro electric power. After Lake Natoma and Folsom Lake were built, the Bureau of Reclamation was given control of operation for both reservoirs and dams.</p>

<p>Mining History:
<br>Before Natoma reservoir was created the section of the American river it now occupies was the site of many gold mining operations in the 1800s.
<br>Around 1956, the Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of Parks and Recreation, also known as State Parks, formed an agreement that State Parks will be responsible for recreational activities on Lake Natoma, as well as Folsom Lake.</p>
